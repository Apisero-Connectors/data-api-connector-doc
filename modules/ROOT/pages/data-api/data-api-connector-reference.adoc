The Commerce Cloud Data Connector is an Operation Based Connector, which means that when you add the connector to your flow, you need to configure a specific operation the connector is intended to perform. Commerce Cloud Data Connector will support OAuth2 configuration, and the details as below.

== Operations

* <<AssignmentsSearch>> {nbsp}


[[AssignmentsSearch]]
== Assignments Search
`<commerce-cloud-dataapi:assignment-search>`


Searches for promotion campaign assignments. The promotion campaign assignment search document contains a search object that allows filtering on various attributes. 
The query attribute specifies a complex query that can be used to narrow down the search. Attributes are grouped into different buckets. The following is a list of searchable attributes with their corresponding buckets:
        
        main:
        
        | Attribute | Type |
        |-----------|--------|
        | rank| Integer |
        | startDate | Date |
        | endDate | Date | 
                          
        campaign:
        
        | Attribute | Type |
        |-----------|--------|
        | campaign| String |
                  
        promotion:
        
        | Attribute | Type |
        |-----------|--------|
        | promotionId| String |
        | description | String |
        | enabled | Boolean |             
                  
        special handling:
        
        | Attribute | Type |
        |-----------|--------|
        | couponId| String |         
          
Only fields in the same bucket can be joined using a disjunction (or). For instance, when joining campaignId and rank, only a conjunction (and) is allowed, 
whereas promotionId and description can be joined to each other using a disjunction because they are in the same bucket. Special handling fields must always use conjunctions. 
If the field is used in a disjunction that violates this rule, an exception is thrown.
Note that only searchable attributes can be used in sorting. 

This operation makes an HTTP POST request to the /pricing/assignments/{{version}}/organizations/{{organizationId}}/assignments endpoint.
